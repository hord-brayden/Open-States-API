How to hookup FedSearch to a Form:

1. Import gravity-forms.json file into gravity forms as a new form, so everything is pre-built.

1. Open findfeds.js in editor, and make sure const debug = true; to log pertinent data into the console.

2. Get a new Google API key from https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?folder=&organizationId=&project=find-my-fed-01, and make a new key, then paste it into findfeds.js as the value for google_api_key.

3. Make sure your const searchBtn is equal to the correct lookup button in your Gravity form.

4. Make sure the const gFormsID is set to the same ID as the Gravity form you imported during step 1 that you imported

5. Proceed to make test calls, and inspect your console to see how the responses are coming in, and what you can do to map the objects to the correct fields.
